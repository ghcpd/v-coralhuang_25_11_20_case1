You are a web developer working inside a persistent code execution session.

Goal
You are given a buggy static HTML UI inside the read-only folder input/.
The file input/README.md contains the full description of the three UI interaction bugs you must fix:

Hover region too small
Disabled button state unclear
Modal backdrop clicks do not close modal and scroll is not restored
Your task is to:

Reconstruct a working project in the current directory (not inside input/)
Fix all UI interaction bugs described in input/README.md
Build a fully reproducible environment
Write real automated UI tests (Playwright required) verifying these behaviors
Provide fully automated setup, run, and test scripts
Ensure everything runs on ANY machine or inside Docker
You must execute all commands and tests for real. No fabrication is allowed.

Input Folder Rules
input/ is read-only. Do NOT modify or remove files in it.
Copy or adapt input/index.html and the bug descriptions in input/README.md into the current directory as needed.
Required Project Structure (must be created in current directory)
index.html — fixed version of input/index.html
Playwright UI tests verifying all three behaviors
package.json — includes Playwright and dependencies
setup.sh — installs Node dependencies and Playwright browsers (idempotent, English only)
run.sh — starts static server on port 3000 (English only)
test.sh — calls setup if needed, starts server, waits for readiness, runs Playwright tests (English only)
Dockerfile — fully reproducible environment that runs setup + tests
README.md — explains bugs (from input/README.md), fixes, setup/run/test usage, Docker usage
Changelog — summarizes created/modified files
Dev Server Rules
Static server must run with:


nohup python3 -m http.server 3000 > /tmp/html.log 2>&1 &

Validate that http://localhost:3000 returns HTTP 200.

Automated Testing Rules (STRICT)
Playwright is required.
Tests must run in a real headless browser.
Tests must verify:
Full-pill hover state
Proper disabled button state (visual + behavioral)
Modal backdrop click closes modal and restores scroll
Curl-only “tests” are forbidden.
Workflow
Inspect input/README.md → understand the three bugs.
Inspect input/index.html → reconstruct index.html in current dir.
Fix UI logic.
Add Playwright tests validating all correct behaviors.
Write setup.sh, run.sh, test.sh, Dockerfile.
Run tests for real and fix until they pass.
Produce README + changelog.
Important Notes
Never write to input/.
All scripts must be non-interactive and in English.
All commands and tests must be executed for real.
Final project must be portable and runnable on ANY machine or inside Docker.

Fixes

index.html (lines 46-149) now treats the entire .nav-button as the hoverable pill and gives the disabled primary button a muted gradient, not-allowed cursor, no hover lift, and pointer-events: none, making the UI state obvious.
index.html (lines 303-413) wires the modal logic to toggle aria-hidden, add/remove a modal-open body class for scroll locking, close when the backdrop (or Escape) is used, and reliably restore scrolling when the modal exits.
Automation

tests/ui.spec.js exercises the hover pill, verifies the disabled button’s styling/behavior, and ensures backdrop clicks hide the modal and release scroll.
Project tooling (package.json, playwright.config.js, setup.sh, run.sh, test.sh, Dockerfile, README.md, Changelog) sets up Playwright, starts the required Python server via nohup, documents usage, and provides a reproducible Docker flow.
Tests

bash -lc './test.sh'
All tests pass; you can rerun ./test.sh (or build/run the Docker image) for full verification.
