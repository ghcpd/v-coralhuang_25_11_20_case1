User: 

You are a web developer working inside a persistent code execution session.

## Goal
You are given a buggy static HTML UI inside the read-only folder `input/`.  
The file `input/README.md` contains the full description of the three UI interaction bugs you must fix:
1. Hover region too small  
2. Disabled button state unclear  
3. Modal backdrop clicks do not close modal and scroll is not restored  

Your task is to:
- Reconstruct a working project in the current directory (not inside `input/`)
- Fix all UI interaction bugs described in `input/README.md`
- Build a fully reproducible environment
- Write **real automated UI tests** (Playwright required) verifying these behaviors
- Provide fully automated setup, run, and test scripts
- Ensure everything runs on ANY machine or inside Docker

You must execute all commands and tests for real. No fabrication is allowed.

---

## Input Folder Rules
- `input/` is read-only. Do NOT modify or remove files in it.
- Copy or adapt `input/index.html` and the bug descriptions in `input/README.md` into the current directory as needed.

---

## Required Project Structure (must be created in current directory)
1. **index.html** — fixed version of `input/index.html`
2. **Playwright UI tests** verifying all three behaviors  
3. **package.json** — includes Playwright and dependencies  
4. **setup.sh** — installs Node dependencies and Playwright browsers (idempotent, English only)  
5. **run.sh** — starts static server on port 3000 (English only)  
6. **test.sh** — calls setup if needed, starts server, waits for readiness, runs Playwright tests (English only)  
7. **Dockerfile** — fully reproducible environment that runs setup + tests  
8. **README.md** — explains bugs (from input/README.md), fixes, setup/run/test usage, Docker usage  
9. **Changelog** — summarizes created/modified files

---

## Dev Server Rules
Static server must run with:
```

nohup python3 -m http.server 3000 > /tmp/html.log 2>&1 &

```
Validate that `http://localhost:3000` returns HTTP 200.

---

## Automated Testing Rules (STRICT)
- Playwright is **required**.
- Tests must run in a real headless browser.
- Tests must verify:
  - Full-pill hover state
  - Proper disabled button state (visual + behavioral)
  - Modal backdrop click closes modal and restores scroll
- Curl-only “tests” are forbidden.

---

## Workflow
1. Inspect `input/README.md` → understand the three bugs.  
2. Inspect `input/index.html` → reconstruct `index.html` in current dir.  
3. Fix UI logic.  
4. Add Playwright tests validating all correct behaviors.  
5. Write setup.sh, run.sh, test.sh, Dockerfile.  
6. Run tests for real and fix until they pass.  
7. Produce README + changelog.

---

## Important Notes
- Never write to `input/`.
- All scripts must be non-interactive and in English.
- All commands and tests must be executed for real.
- Final project must be portable and runnable on ANY machine or inside Docker.

Completed: *Install deps and run tests* (2/2)

All done — I fixed the three UI bugs, added Playwright tests, and made a fully reproducible setup + test environment.

What I changed and added
- Fixed index.html (root) to resolve:
  - Hover region too small — entire profile pill now responds to hover (.nav-button:hover).
  - Disabled button state unclear — :disabled uses lower contrast, no hover lift, not-allowed cursor, pointer-events none.
  - Modal closing behavior — backdrop clicks close the modal and close restores body scroll; Escape closes modal; scrollable demo content added for tests.
- Added automated tests (Playwright) that verify:
  - Full-pill hover state (visual).
  - Disabled primary button both visually and behaviorally.
  - Modal backdrop click closes modal and restores scroll (also close button).
- Added automation & CI artifacts:
  - package.json (Playwright)
  - setup.sh (installs node deps and Playwright browsers)
  - run.sh (starts static server on port 3000 using required command)
  - test.sh (setup -> start server -> wait -> run Playwright tests)
  - playwright.config.js and ui.spec.js (Playwright tests)
  - Dockerfile (full reproducible environment)
  - README.md and CHANGELOG.md

Key files (root of repository)
- index.html — fixed demo
- ui.spec.js — Playwright tests
- setup.sh, run.sh, test.sh — automation scripts
- Dockerfile — reproducible environment
- README.md — run/test instructions
- CHANGELOG.md — summary of created files

How to run locally (Linux / macOS / WSL)
1. Setup (installs dependencies + browsers):
   bash setup.sh
2. Start server (background):
   bash run.sh
   (uses: nohup python3 -m http.server 3000 > /tmp/html.log 2>&1 &)
3. Run tests:
   bash test.sh

Docker (runs tests inside container)
- Build & run:
  docker build -t ui-bug-fix .
  docker run --rm ui-bug-fix

Automated tests were executed here and all Playwright tests passed (3/3).

If you want, I can:
- Add CI pipeline config (GitHub Actions) to run tests automatically.
- Bump Playwright and lock file / pin versions.
